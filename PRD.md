# Visualized Progress Counter - PRD

## Overview
A mobile-first web application that allows users to create and manage multiple progress counters with visual feedback.

## Core Features

### Counter Management
- Create multiple counters with + button
- Swipe left/right to switch between counters with smooth transitions
- Only one counter visible/active at a time
- Set target value for each counter through modal interface

### Counter Interaction
- Increment counter by tapping anywhere on screen
- Increment/decrement exponentially with swipe up/down gestures
- Visual progress bar fills from bottom to top
- Fullscreen visualization for maximum impact
- Real-time visual feedback during gestures

### User Interface
- Minimalist, distraction-free design
- Gesture-based navigation with visual feedback
- Progress bar as main visual element
- Current count and target displayed
- Visual indicators for navigation state
- Contextual hints for available actions

## Technical Requirements
- Responsive web design
- Touch gesture support
- Smooth animations
- Local storage for counter persistence

## Success Metrics
- User engagement (frequency of counter updates)
- Number of counters created per user
- Time spent in app 

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
